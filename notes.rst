Good
####

- Shared structure between tests and code
- Thorough error checking (with messages to user!)
- Stated consideration of memory consumption
- Documentation is clear and sufficiently detailed
- Making things into dictionaries
- I can run the code
- Idiomatic use of dicts as "objects"
- There were like two places I wanted to lint the code

Bad
###

- Fasta parsing could be more modular
- Dicts could be namedtuples in some cases
